This build directory contains a Premake configuration script and pre-generated
build configrations for a number of platforms.

You can generate your own build by downloading Premake 4 for your platform from 
http://industriousone.com/premake/download and run it from the directory
containing premake4.lua.

Run the generate_all.sh to regenerate configurations for Linux, MacOS X and
Windows.
